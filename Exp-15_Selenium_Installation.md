# Selenium Installation

Step 1: Update the System

First, update your system's package index:

```bash
sudo yum update -y
```

Step 2: Install Python

If Python is not already installed, you can install it. AWS Linux 2 comes with Python 2.7 by default, but it's recommended to use Python 3.

```bash
sudo yum install python3 -y
```

Step 3: Install Selenium

Use pip to install Selenium:

```bash
pip3 install selenium
```
